  Critical Success Factors for Bar Coupons
Bar Visit Frequency is the Strongest Predictor
  High-frequency bar goers (>3 times/month): ~76% acceptance rate
  Low-frequency bar goers (â‰¤3 times/month): ~37% acceptance rate
  Key Insight: You are twice as likely to accept a bar coupon if you frequent bars regularly
Age + Bar Frequency Combination
  Adults over 25 who visit bars >1/month: Higher acceptance rates
  This demographic shows strong correlation with coupon acceptance
Passenger Context Matters
  Drivers without kids as passengers: Higher acceptance rates
  Non-widowed drivers: Better acceptance rates
  Occupation factor: Those NOT in farming/fishing/forestry show higher acceptance
Income + Restaurant Behavior
  Lower income (<$50K) + frequent cheap restaurant visitors (>4 times/month): Higher bar coupon acceptance
  This suggests cross-category behavioral patterns
